# kappaET2X_AFM_SC
Code implementation of a fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation and a linearized Eliashberg equation, which searches for Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity in an antiferromagnetic state of $\kappa$-type organic materials. For the reduction of Matsubara frequencies, [SparseIR.jl](https://github.com/SpM-lab/SparseIR.jl/tree/main) package is used in the code.

Details on the method and results can be found in S. Sumita, M. Naka, and H. Seo, arXiv:2308.*****.
